I will be discontinuing this mod as of version 3.3.4, because as much as I've loved all the joy I've brought to people by making this mod, I hate developing for it.

I'm not happy with the torch/slab blending, and a lot of the features that are added are added in a way that can (and has) broken other mods and modpacks. I can't think of a better way to do what I've done with this mod, but if you can than feel free to, I would love for someone to build or remake this mod, I just hope they take some notes so that it isn't a framerate killer.

That being said, I'm not done modding, I have a mod called [Bedrock Features](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/bedrock-features) that I plan on keeping updated well into the future, and am open to ideas moving forward.
I will attempt to make a library that does what this mod does but considerably less "janky", for lack of a better term, however it will not automatically make slabs able to be vertical or mixed, as that will become an opt-in feature at the discretion of the modders. We'll have to wait and see.

Thank you all for downloading this mod, reporting issues/suggestions, etc., it genuinely means a lot to me and I wish I could still develop this mod and be happy with the code I've made for it.

Thank you,

Micah
