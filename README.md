This mod adds vertical slabs and mixed horizontal and vertical slabs to Minecraft. Also adds KleeSlabs-like behavior, which makes it so you can break each slab in half separately. Works with slabs from other mods, please report an issue to my mod if there's a slab that doesn't work with it.

#### Requirements: 
- Cloth Config
- Malilib (optional)

#### Incompatibility: 
- Optifine/Optifabric. 

#### Known Bugs: 
- BClib/BetterX slabs
- If you use Sodium, you have to install Indium otherwise the game wil crash!

This is a Fabric mod. There is no Forge version planned.

You are allowed to use this, free of charge and without permission, in any modpack of your choosing.

Support is immensely appreciated.
